## cut tool
The cut command in linux is a command for cutting out the sections from each line of files and writing the result to standard output. It can be used to cut parts of a line by byte position, character, and field. The cut command slices a line and extracts the text. It is necessary to specify an option with a command otherwise it gives an error. If more than one file name is provided then data from each file is not preceded by its file name. 

### Usage:

 - `python3 cut.py [-f] [-d] [filename]`
 - `cat [Text] | python3 cut.py [-f] [-d]`

### Example:
 - `python3 cut.py -f1,2 sample.tsx`
 - `python3 cut.py -f"1,2" -d, fourchords.csv`
 - `head -n5 fourchords.csv | python3 cut.py -d, -f"1 2"`

### Tip:
Create a bash alias cccut or ccut = python3 cut.py to make this tool even more authentic.
